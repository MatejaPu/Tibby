            <h3>5 Reasons Why Yoga is So Good For You:</h3>
            <h4 class="sub-header">1. Lowers stress and improves your mood</h4>
            <p>Some yoga methods use specific meditation techniques, which focus the mind on your breathing to quieten
                the constant ‘mind chatter’, relieves stress and allow you to feel relaxed. Practising these breathing
                techniques on a yoga and meditation retreat can also boost oxygen levels to the brain, leaving you
                feeling happier and more content with everyday life.</p>
            <h4 class="sub-header">2. Boosts confidence</h4>
            <p>SoAside from the uplifting spiritual values, the act of meditation can actually boost your confidence.
                The process works by releasing tension from your mind, so that you can feel confident about your
                physical body. Without any forms of anxiety, you are able to establish an internal connection with
                yourself. This is consequently reflected in your perception of others and will help to better your
                relationships by improving compassion and awareness.</p>
            <h4 class="sub-header">3. Lowers the risk of injury</h4>
            <p>Exercise such as running is usually a series of rapid, forceful movements, which means that effort is
                at a maximum and there is a higher risk of injury and increased muscle tension. Often, strenuous
                exercise also engages an imbalance of opposing muscle groups, whereas yoga concentrates on balancing
                this activity. Unite your body and mind on a yoga and fitness holiday which will allow to combine more
                intense workouts with low-impact yoga.</p>
            <img class="content-img" src="public/yoga_2.png" alt="">
            <h4 class="sub-header">4. Helps you lose weight</h4>
            <p>Being overweight is a sign that there are imbalances in your everyday life and one major contributor to
                weight gain is excess stress. Practising yoga enables you to bring a deep sense of relaxation to your
                body and your mind, helping you to de-stress and allowing you to lose weight naturally.</p>
            <h4 class="sub-header">5. Increases flexibility</h4>
            <p>People often say that they are not flexible enough to do yoga. The truth is, it doesn’t matter how
                tight your muscles are as yoga asanas works by safely stretching your muscles and help you to practise
                it further. Moreover, yoga also stretches other soft tissue in the body such as ligaments and tendons,
                increasing the range of motion in the joints and allowing you to move around more freely.</p>
